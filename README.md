#TextBoxFacil

Some text areas are very small in REDCap. 

Just press the combination "shift+spacebar" when you are working in any text area or input field. 
Then, TextBoxFacil will be shown.
TextBoxFacil is a bigger and dynamic text area 
designed to help to edit formulas and texts when the size of the REDCap textboxes are too small to be edited confortably.
TextBoxFacil  will be automatically populated with the same  text or formula you are working,  and once you are done editing, just close  TextBoxFacil and your text/code will be placed again in the ogriginal edit area.
