Some text areas are very small in REDCap. 

Press the combination "ctrl+spacebar" when you are working in any text area or input field and TextBoxFacil will pop open.
TextBoxFacil is a bigger and dynamic text area designed to help to edit formulas and texts when the size of the REDCap textboxes are too small to be edited comfortably.
TextBoxFacil automatically populates the same text or formula you are currently working on into the TextBoxFacil area. When you are done editing, close TextBoxFacil and your text/code will be placed into the originally edited area.
